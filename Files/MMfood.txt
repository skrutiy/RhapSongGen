Beef rap 
Could lead to gettin teeth capped 
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap 
I suggest ya change ya diet 
It can lead ta high blood pressure if ya fry it 
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease 
It ain't no startin back once arteries start ta squeeze 
Take the easy way out phony, until then 
They know they wouldn't be talkin that bologna in the bullpen 
So disgustin, pardon self as I discuss this 
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice 
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet 
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'a boil it 
He be better off on PC glued 
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood 
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed (food, we need food!)

He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh 
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous 
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit 
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit 
Her bra smell, his card say: aw hell 
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel' 
Keep a cooker where the jar fell 
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell 
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears 
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares 
The odd pairs swears and God fears 
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years 
I wrote this note around New Year's 
Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares? 
Enough about me, it's about the beats 
Not about the streets and who food he about ta eat 
A rhymin cannibal who's dressed to kill, it's cynical 
Whether is it animal, vegetable, or mineral 
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical 
And proceed to move the crowd like a old Negro spiritual 
For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello 
Tell 'em devil's hell no, sell y'all own Jello 
We hollow krills, she swallow pills 
He follow flea collar three dollar bills 
And squeal for halal veal, in y'all appeal 
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal 
Twirl a L after every meal (FOOD)

What up 
To all rappers shut up with ya shuttin up 
And keep your shirt on, at least a button up 
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin males? 
Outta work jerks since they shut down Chippendale's 
They chippin nails, Doom... jippin scales 
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin sales 
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin bail 
Dippin jail, whippin tail, and sippin ale 
Light the doobie til it glow like a ruby 
After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby 
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit 
Overproof drunk shit, and who'da thunk it? 
Punk try an ask why ours be better 
It could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater 
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD nude (we need food!)

KEEP YA HOES IN CHECK!(..Super!) 
I got this girl and she wants me to duke Her 
I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said "Super!"

and the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa

or beat her to a stupor, take it from the "Super!"
ya need to make her feel cuter
and lay down the G like Luther, everythin'll be "Super!"

so she look sweet when she go to meet the "Super!"
got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
put it in the air, come 'ere, kiss it
listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
when she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
which will have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo"
her name on ya back in her tattoo

make sure for extra wreck let 'em know how you feel
and while he's runnin down to all star weekend to ball
I'm comin with the U-HAUL!(Super!)
(..Super!) (...Super!)

I strive to be humble lest I stumble 
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with it's mumbo sauce 
Tyson is a Fowl holocaust
Fill and gas your whole head up with poetry I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bluh
Stand up get up
Lunge for your knife
Don't forget your potholders

What
These old things
About to throw them away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like O.J
Usually I take them off with oil of ole
MC's is crabs in a barrel pass the old bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day in it
Working on a way that we roll away tinted
Some say the price of holdin heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoe pie
[never too busy]
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
[Swear to god]
A lot of niggaz wish to die
Need to hold they horses
There's bigger fish to fry
Your on the list
If not hit the number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumbaclot
Could have had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight
Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy that night that tried to rush me
Dwight pass da dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side it wont get blistered
Got it
What happened oh it's not lit
These metal fingers be holding hot shit

When I was four I pen god was born in new york
Back in seventy seven still got nan in the crescent
The effervescent of gods presence is thick
Unlike vapor
Escarole
extra roll
Word to the baker
Peace to the hard working ginger bread makers
Looked her up and down said hmmmm too much make up
Poor music taste
Ten years from being grown up
Rappers don't blow up heads do
[awwwww shit]
My name is Dwight Spits
I'ma sonic addict
I use to think it was merely a dangling habit
Born under a bad sign
I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it in the fine wine
Barely born a virgin is what the stars said
Black not white red all over doe like elmo
Twenty eight years have passed I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore
A fact of life
A labor of love
I get mad love but I can test the labor
And it's wages
You know death
I serving life from this gift of god
Don't forget your potholders my niggaz

There is only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me
Do a number on the label
Eat up all their MC's and drink 'em under the table like
It's on me
Put it on my tab kid
However you get there
Foot it, Cab it, Iron horse it
You leaving on your face forfeit
I crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it
He told her he lost it
She told him get off it, and a bunch other more shit
Getting money
DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
It's da weed give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough
The group been soft
First hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her dareair
It read to wide load this yard bird taste like fried toad
Turned love villain
Take pride and code words
Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to dine by the pizza guy
No he's not to fly to skeet in a skezzers eye
And squeeze her thigh
Maybe giver her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call him super when they need their back or plumbing fixed
Powers only one left the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three
A hood tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like what you doing G
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me
Looser than a pair of adidas
I hope you bought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
Dude can't do his thing again no matter how be blinging
You do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for tellie tubbies
Few can do it even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask like a tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out
One, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shootie nobody move nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy I'm going to war
Came in the door, and everybody on the floor
A whole string of jobs like we are on tour
Everynight on the score coming to your corner store

As you call em, they call you when they need somethin 
Trees for the blunt 'n, to g's for the frontin
I found a way to get piece of mind for years
And left the hell alone, turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter, or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright wit surprise, once they finish spittin lies
Asssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggaz, homies?
close, but really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn't even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: no feeding the baboon
Seein as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Ya'll know the dance, they smile in ya face, ya'll know the glance
Try ta put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know ya plans
Is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see
You telling me, I try ta act broke
Jealousy, the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type a spell, like crack smoke
Ghetto cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I check the dictionary for the meanin of Friends
It said: Person, one who likes to socialize with
Sympathise and help her, and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, goin wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggaz off like a light switch
(Click!) an when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night (Bow!) what a riot
I first met Mister Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how yer moms'll feel
When it get for real, the steel get to sparkin
Everything darken, and ain't no talkin
For somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin ta plot the bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is...
Some come in the form of co-dependence
Alotta times only end up bein co-defendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, beggin for a penance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory
Before lovers we used to have some type of overstanding
Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know its no strings
We could do the damn thing, but hoe its no rings
Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?
That depends on how good was the skins
And could she memorize the lessons, it ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just... (friends)
FRIENDS! How many of us have them?
FRIENDS! Ones we can depend on?
FRIENDS! How many of us have them?
FRIENDS! Before we go any furthur....

I tripped a lot out here in the woods lately

This is a platter of, this makes an, an exceptionally good late night's snack and also a dandy fly swatter
Ah, my eyes are going, I can't hit it

Nothing comes between me and my masters

(What is it father?)
These footprints were by, by the flying monkey men
(But they've been restrained in the Valley since we made the pig feet)
Yes, that is what disturbs me

He'd probably get indigestion
You will go
(I don't think so
Take them)

This jungle is dangerous Trapper
You will need assistance
(I know what I'm doing)

You risked your life for us, thanks

I lost an arm
(Good)
Stop it father
(Stand back
Return to the house)
No

What the?
Now Trapper, perhaps you will listen

You gotta watch your gums on this
But it's, it's very good, it's very healthy

(Not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal)
You would only want to use the wraps when there's no food associated with the use of the wraps
So, uh, some potential uses include, um, wrapping bolt packed in a larger package
And in that case, the, the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked, cooked your meats
Um, there's also been interest in, um, development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day
(It's hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things
Create a new demand for produce
Stop throwing out as much garbage as they do
And eat more chitlins)

Darker than the East river, larger than the Empire State
Where the beasts to guard the barbed wire gate is on the job not my fate
Tired of the wait till the villain bring deliverance from the dire straits, fire at a higher rate
Why'd they make the liars, fliers scatter, buy a plate, isolate the wires
Try the straight pliers if not the vice grips
A real price saver way to acquire nice whips
What a steal for real on wheels of steel
Stunner a funner summer number one meal deal bummer
A bizarre phenomenon is your armor on
Take your cash, Karma, or break your fast, Ramadan
Transaction drama, aww come on Barney
Clack clack, pardon me, whack rap con carne
He came to feed the childrens like Sally Struthers
After that he's going back to Cali where's the (Love is)

Wilder than the Nile, hold power like the great pyramids of Giza
And stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza
Raw with the pen and on the mic off the hezza
Get shot off that wide eyed talk
If he had a pot he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street person
Lookin' for the perfect beat coercion into heat burstin'
They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that comes with a free hot plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3D ring sittin' stationary like B.B. King
Can see how it really sting, it ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motocross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus
Me and Sub is like the brown Smothers Brothers (Love is)

Vaster than the seven seas, bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro
If they don't know, fill them in tomorrow on the horror show
A mental note, return Bob's record
Swear to god before he gets a job, he robs Eckerd
Blessed with a hot flow, tested, it got dough
Invested in stress the best to finesse an opto
As I reminisce never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the Henny straight couldn't afford to cop the cherry coke
Or should I say broke with wealth?
To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke theyself
Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it
Dog gone it, do the statistics
How he bust lyrics was too futuristic for ballistics
And far too eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc the Hip Hop Hendrix

In my pocket, a note
(It's from my father
From the guard's whip, is this a trick?)
Why would I resort to trickery?
You're already a prisoner
What do I gain by deceiving you?
(You can't blame me for being suspicious)
No (Love is)

Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the drill that gave my spine chills
All thirty-three nerves controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like sent from above
You not a soul-mate, more ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions outta here. sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me
I couldn't see, holdin' onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

I shoulda deaded it from genesis 'stead of hittin' the Guinnesses
Now I'm free falling, cursing at the street, bawling
He ceased calling, no appetite for feast darling
So deep, all in, I bet he never stop balling women
Forsake God for the scent of a man
Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?
Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment
Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it
Damn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke
Steady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats
Sniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope?
Propose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

Constant frustration, stemming from a no win situation
Rushing lust and fornication, adding to the complication
Patience is a virtue, pain run deep when love desert you
Listenin' to whisperin', choosing chaos over discipline
Simpleton, life should really be a piece of intimance
Relationships strengthening, flower essence penstemon
Gentlemen my favorite shit so I've never forsaken it
I persevere, make it fit, sculpting and reshaping it
Taking sips off a fifth of it, passionate, intense
Incense candles lit, scandalous
Emotional bandages, why would he abandon this?
Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

Look
(Oh boy, here we go)

Come on you college boys wearing them faggotty-looking white shoes

Ya didn't wash your neck
(Take a look at my neck)

Hold it right there you
Where you're going, there are no jokes

I'm beginning to think that armor-plated gargoyle doesn't like me

...Give it a sec for the pain to start
This wreck right here it ain't for the faint of heart
They thought they saw the worst verse
From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first
Once they get to know us people dig us
Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggaz
Inventor of the more demented flow nobody doubt it
This go for if ya bout it bout it or rowdy rowdy
Whatever's clever the master fold
Who every hooka heard a but now HO NO
If we see tomorrow the next day classes
The villain in the back with the x-ray glasses
Have no fear the ninja here
Feel em like the tinge in ya ear from drinkin ginger beer
When it's on loco head gon' lay low
And heat it like beef patty coco bread con queso
If you say so lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halo's
Say OH if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash then a stash in a peso
Okay yo ya'll know who to follow
Tie em up in the crib and leave the place hollow
..Oh shoot the goose shes loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste cous cous
Stash the deuce deuce
Troops askin truce truce
Today on intense wreck week
We have the super villain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks
Train the same brain to a insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain ya support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make ya daughta laugh
Then slaughta the ass
Seem em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do something and never be back once he leave the scene
Keep more medicated pads then Stridex
For his own sidewrecks with no known side effects
Before you press charges use ya noodle
So what when he grab the mic he scratch ya cute cuticles
Keep ya mouth shut everything'll be beautiful
It would be often rude to you now get back to ya hooty hoo
Damnit it ain't worth the drama can it
From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in he lit the room
Boom reschedule my noon with Britt Hume (Doom!)
In love with Mary Jane she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that webhead what a lame brain
Maintain say it don't spray it
Wanna see ya girl again ya might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer who bust guns
I'll have a cool mill for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One two microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home-Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage its like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
Jump off the stage like "Yee haw!"

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

Type profile low, like A in Paid in Full
Attract heavy cash 'cause the game's centripetal
Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic
Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown nosing nigga, fake-ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas, come get me 'cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangster like a old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah yeah, tell 'em "Tell it on the mountain hill"
Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through the bubble vest or double-breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap
Son shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rap snitch knishes

It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs was touchin' never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell yous
Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, "Daddy funk me"
I'm like anywho's
Seeds walkin' all out in street with out any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox
Instead she wanna hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory glory, it's like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low
Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo
Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier
Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated in deep theta
Let her hate the creep later
Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
Say he stay self medicated to sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ewww
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit (DOOM)

One little evening alone home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking e-mails
All I got is messages from ass-naked females (Cookies)
I don't know a Jenny
She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
(Night, night) Okay honey, sweet dreams
Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal hand full, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I right there with ya
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you could do the same till he get home
Fat chance, at least he get snacks
That will have to do till a brother get back
Until then, smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers
Acting all hard, bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is, "Thirteenth cell, put the sheet down"
Damn CO, what the hell do she know
Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The whiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, it's hard to drink without it
And could use some cookies but trying not to think about it
Watching BET on jazz for knowledge on file
Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch, like we got for lunch
Chocolate fudge butter crunch

Don't mess with the Ritz Bits
Wheat Thins, Saltines, or Triscuits (No)
Matzos or Cheez-Its
Catch sugar fits every time that he sees a nice pair of
Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
Even the Oreos, no matter what weather
Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
In the game he's shameless
Even uses a codename Famous Amos
It's cheaper than a short stay at the day's inn
And good like twenty-five cent oatmeal raisin
Give a hand to who invented the camera
Never mind the gingerbread man or the grandmas
Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
Or get caught with a handful of cream fill
(Cookies) It might seem ill

(Go wash your hands)
Cookies
(Oh, cookies)

We shall now vote for a new world leader
I nominate DOOM
All in favor say, "Aye"
(Aye) Oh no
(Point blank)

DOOM is master of the world
(I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book)
You've disturbed me for the last time

Hey you know something gang?
That DOOM ain't really all bad
(What do you mean Ben?)
Well on account of him, I'm having real good time I mean
Between you and me, I kinda like being black
(Well maybe if we're lucky, he'll attack us once more and send you back Benjamin)
Haha very funny, very very funny

(He must be mad)
No, if anyone can do it
Nevertheless let's get out of here while we can
(Food, we need food)
