It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds is they limits cause we in 'em; eyes low
Squinted, more Ls but we winning acting like it's
Hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens
Remember those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ants, and it's only the beginning
Big pimpin', pull a dime, drop 'em for they innocence
Skate like mens' flow, sweet like cinnamon
He a child, but they treat him like a bigger man
Cause when the pen in his hand, he bake 'em up like he Jigga man
Know you see him in the mirror fam, the ones you say
You ain't hot but your biggest fan like, "Nigga, damn."
Before he got popular, he bit the man
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram
Got it with the grams, everybody say they dissed a fan
Know the haters too jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam
It's the fuckin' jam

Yea
You remember back in the days when you used to rocks waves and shit
When like...yo I had the fucking 360 my nigga
Like nobody in the hood was fucking my shit
And that's real shit

Since nine five, momma been working nine five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs, and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful will have me in the Daily Postal
Flying coastal eatin tofu
Like I told you I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than descendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin “what happened?"
I’m back to the chapter
Momma told me follow dreams and never have to ask her, to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask em "Who is Joey Bad?"
Watch em grasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found it your retinal
And they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north, speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless it was some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes

What, what the rap audience ain't ready for, is a real person
You know what I wanna say, a real N-I-G-G-A. I'm comin' at 'em a hundred percent real. I ain't compromisin' nothin'
Anybody that talk about me got problems. You know what I'm sayin'? It's gon' be straight up like if I was a street person.
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world, and I'm bein' real about it and I'mma grow wit' my music

Yeah, but it's far from over
Won't stop til' I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
Til' I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like super novas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like 3 times, have 3 kids, I hope
Me & wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge cuz yeah, they 'gon need it
Cuz when my fam tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that the advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, our punishments they grew more crucial
So use the word brutal, cuz my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attracts the likes of even Madlib
Go call a mansion and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine

Imagine

I'mma make it all happen

My man Dirty had to boot it
Just to put me in my right mind
I rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines
Siked dimes a slice, closed eyes
I'm sliced so by, why you ain't to go
That given thrown so by
Laugh it out by the pole light
Show Shorty to the back room
Place your race she acting like a vacuum
Showed her to the door before the afternoon
She fell hard on the floor
So you know that she'll be back soon
Fake MC get their raps wrong
Young villans up upon a track
And the track doom, click clack boom
Ressurect and boom back from the tomb
Drags dope like crack in cocoons
Back in this move, back on the move
It's the motherfucking real, nigga, chill, act cool
Pay respect to the cat drew
And I'm way too blessed
To be dough with shots, that's true

Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realer

I'm trying to find my own lane
In this freeway life
Just remember homeboy
It ain't no free way to life
My nigga has gone haas
Tryin' not to lose his soul
'Til the rims holes are gone
'Cause once the devil drive on
That nigga ain't letting go
And I'm far from religious
I just know right and wrong
I know how to write these songs
I know how to light these bongs
I know how to rip thongs
And I'm pretty good and being bald
Nigga, I'm so crazy, Nigga I'm loco gased up
Like Scirocco pressed the pedal to the floor
But you out the door
Bitch loved it in here, no more
'Cause I weave low, faking in a Louie bag
Weap chick I tried to back, 'cause she had the nerve
To turn me down, heard the song and turned around
Now she want me to enter her pants
But I'm gone bitch, missed your chance

Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer

I got sick in class started making classics
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and, bus asses
I'm sure they'll blow like bust acid
Puff acids, like Mav' chuchu Maverick
And I'm average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit but you still can't pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescence, they be having rapping secession's over adding lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I'm trying to multiply
Monopolies and tax the homies, then divide the cheese
Divide lexus to resize the lease
So my eyes could see through the ease
Shown you all how about decease
A part of see, after asses like apostrophes
You can't stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part of the cheese, head at the spot and leave
Apologies for apology

Joey Bad and Chuck Strangers
Leaving niggas in danger
Joey Bad, leaving niggas in danger

It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

Niggas don't want war I'm a martian with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel writing intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyns the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay so,
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wall like they lightyear, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit out to inaugurate
My P.E conglomerates bout to P-E-E on any wanna B-E, weak MC
Here I'm out to leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go:
{Ba boom Ba boom Ba boom boom Ba boom}
Hispanic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that K
Like every day in every way and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is pray
Cause when niggas start equipin'
And throw the clip in
Your blood drippin'
And got you slippin'
Under the victim, don't know what's hit them
Through his spinal, just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like you're so right
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E, Public Enemy, Assassinator, bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything son
Fuck government, Fuck, listenin' and shit

You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

There's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they use to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards
Wiping out motherboards
Started spitting fire cause my motherfuckin lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
With a mind of finest interests for your finest interests
They say hard work pays off, well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
Cause P.E's about to take off, with protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous, finger to the president screamin' "fuck censorship! "
If Obama got that president election then them P.E boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan and pokemon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin Uzi's cause it's given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man try and disrespect it, send a message and it's over in a mili second
Nigga

I'm a beast with these flows
2 birds one stone, you get geese when trees roll
They say I'm evil cause I trained my eagle to see gold
See, no seagulls couldn't see these goals
Please, it's the return of the beast coast
No cash, flash put the cheese still make teeth show
The cold needle, is how you move on a strip, you trynna be Vito?, well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, ya'll ain't real spitters, ya'll lips chapped
Better watch the Mr. Nicewatch, don't risk/wrist that
I got a 6 pack of bear/bare skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (THAT SHIT CRAY!)
Ya'll niggas softspoken, down below token
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
It makes sense you want beef with this frozen
It nuts for new school, in the tool, ya' kid hold him
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico
A lyrical spanish, with a dance that's demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu standin'
Ain't no half steppin' 'round me
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
That young cop killer, I'm dat I'll, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer

Soul searchin' 'till my flows are perfect
I ain't trynna be a slave to grow old from workin'
Sorry BADA$$, you lucky that I peeped the second
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection
Check the melody, it's so heavenly
That shit'll get your hips to move no 70's
All the Opium, can I bust soliloquies
Got that shit mix and mastered both remedies
Grab a spoonful, sturrin' up a pot
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot
I'm flowin' like a volcano, drippin' verses while drippin' verses off the top
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my genes, don't worry where my pants is
Get with the script it's that ignorant shit
And they bound to get sick off of this quick
But I sealin' my lips, it's a shift
I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberries it's a jam
So throw up both hands if you can
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit
Until they bury me, my volume is going in depth with longevity

Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wildin'
He look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glarin' signs
The sympathy zippity
Only thing plain is the mad violence
No lyin' niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn ya molecules until you let go ions
Sleep beef like they let go lions
So don't eye em' they get the wrong message
Wrong message put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me boy dress up I'm givin' too many lectures
And I'm puttin' in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like they gon' catch up fuck what you must heard
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listenin' to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressin' and shine, define

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Just got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and what not
The motto never changed it's still fuck cops
We went from havin' lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs is hot whenever we puff pot
We touch blocks and end up havin a gut shot
But fuck that, ain't tryna live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can't be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your fade is your only escape
Fuck a priest's opinion
Knock the hinges off of Heaven's gates
Tryna share my cells with' my mate
Not share a cell with' mates
Wreckin' shit with' my wrecklessness
The L get lit that's when I start second guessin' shit
Thinkin' 'bout Tot and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could've fuck me over
Never nigga guess again
I'm street so cross me like pedestrians
And that's gon be your end of it
Straight revokin' your membership

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kid
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna know what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Niggas wanna know what I'm about
I'm bout blowin' loud on the block sporty
GLOCK 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out
Commission with' my composition
Who the kid spittin' behind the bars
Like a con position
Gotta give 'em time to listen
They'll soon bump to it they'll like me
I kick it like Nike they'll adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain't mad at you I keep my attitude on school
Learn ya bucks to do it
I'm out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me
Who the bestest MC?
They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molestin' the beat
Fuck math, teachers shoul teach
If it keep Smith & Wesson's off the street
So first class be a lesson from me
Fuck what you teach if it's a riggies
I fly it over liggies
All time highs where Jesus can't reach us
Step to me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers
Hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot
GLOCK cocked watchin' out for cops
All about they cheddar
Youngins know nothin' that's better
Like fuck a prison letter
Those Beretta's led us to the lettuce
Real as fetishes menaces
Want the senator's percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemisis
Smokin' on the Clematis
Get open like a present is
Now yo presence is on the premisces for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linkin terrorists from the Stuy
Then linkin terraces
They on that wrecker shit
They leave you left for the dead
Kids don't play they'll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slingin' some reds
Poppin' some meds
Shits be so deep in cover they be chasin' the feds
I be back stage grippin' haze breakin' my leg
My folks was makin' the best
When they was naked in bed, muthafucka

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Aye yo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow?
Point 'em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?

Check!

Puffing stramonium underground like pieholes
Look on their flasshole
These bars like writing espressioni
And these folks are for custodians
Homeless man only goldregen do
Risin' at my laptop looking at
Ref on opium truth
They like to throw you in room
I'm like if only you knew
I'm only in school for cosmology
That's why I act as lonely as you
You see I'm wise behind my years and my past
And my voice over the stairs
Is the only way they hear
With a copy on my membrane
But I've been smoking chem strain
So lately I've been having hard times
With remembering
And be patient, my flood is proving
Gipsies ain't shit
'Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix
But fuck it I'm a rap it momma likely and adequitly
'Til I drove into static with my slimatic anatomy
And come out into in PD with fugitives at blue prison hill mad is
I've been going roll, this shit's how I feel rappin'
You get y'all serve chapters so I can't even guess this
We taught you how to be proten but still it's acting in messes
Y'all better get back your asses
'Cause we 'bout to annihilate
My empire gate seem the Empire State
I'm on now on your platform
Look at the way they clap for 'em
Never fuck with funny man
'Cause I don't like my back tone
Nigga ain't squat, diss that top
You ain't used too
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through
No beef like nunu's
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through
I tell 'em
No beef like nunu's
It's world domination, nation
You're tuned in to my station
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top
With my fucking world domination, nation
You're tuned in to my station
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top
With my fucking team

Yeah
Another love song gone wrong
So know you are a WOOP
Like based God in wonton
But I didn't
And I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball
But I'm still glad I hit it
'Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know
Coulda shoulda type like,
"Oh, it was like, too tight"
Come on, I would've pipe
But our schedules contradicted
Well I was tied down hey pipe down
First night ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown
And whipped out the slanky
Then she screamed, "Joey spank me"
And after that she even thanked me, swanky
One time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we'll be kicking rhymes
'Til the end of time
But back to the topic
Oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off
And wondering why shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga
Do miss the lip gloss
Now she sucked some next nigga dick off
And my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm posed to do
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent the postcards so you know it's true
I promise that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you frontin like you don't miss my whole cock
Pit down your esophagus
Screaming, "daddy stop it"
Ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polish in the scratches of my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky roll
And I tried to suck your titties whole
For milk for my cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came
I hit that spot twice and since then
You haven't been the same
Now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name
But my first impression: what a lame
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with a shoulder stain
Faggot
Six months, and I'm still at it
You probably never hear this track
But I still rap it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you to not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and it's kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't be reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah

Words to my mother
Two things I never do
Is leave the crib without some rubbers
Or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get
A brother caught up
In this sticky situation
Missing menstruation
Cycles, they all psycho
Ask Michael
Before you give a note
For Billie Jean's and the nice clothes
Like woo don't let them trap you
On the tight rope with spike holes
In the condom to form a zygote over night
Ask Quan he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch
I knew this rap shit
And put it over life
On the coldest nights
And shine like the solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases pipe
Chicks in to weirdest places
From roof tops, to staircases
Like get a load on their faces
Face it if you fear hate it
You get put it on this girls face

I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin

Hey yo, I'm attached too, to the cash rules
Bout to go nuts niggas get their attitudes
To these cash you
Who you know that cool that they drip swagoo
And I'm here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga that's the second time
I passed you, eating my gas fume
Got me thinking I could gas you
And your girl got gas too
She let me tackle before I touch and I staple
And as you decide to put her shackle
I'm that dude, fuck values
Pump up the volume, all up in the cut
No alchool just bad booze
Tryin to find the path to bring him back too
Like a taboo, that poo, got back chicks
That I feel bad for
Loosing 'til they back bones
Look it at my cock tip
Down and doin' all no matter what the synapsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
And all your conscience tap exclusively vodka and shit

I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin

From the block to the top
Budha baggies in a sock
Only thing that changed now
Is we ain't runnin' out of stock
Use to beg mom dukes for lunch money
Honies used to run from me
When pockets was dust bunnies
Now what's funny
Is when done came up and conquered
Even the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers
Though them gangstas grill
I tell 'em keep that drama away
Don't fuck with thieves
I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape
They launchin' out straights
I'm tryin' not to get sprayed
Whether it's spitter or a quiter behind the trigger
Approachin' his prey his eyes bigger
Won't stop to consider what's right or wrong
Because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver

But that's just daily routine
The streets is couped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth
Niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you can think you cool with yo nice things
Get wiped cleaned for ice cream when the light speed

Traded in my Nikes for a new mic
I guess it's safe to say
He sold soles for his new life
Like they were tryna blind us
But we know the true designer
They didn't wanna see us find the diviners
So now we hit the vines
Up day and night on the regular
I know my momma prayin'
Like she want me reach my aims in life
But just stay in sight
So I'm shootin' for my dreams
Hit the booth and it boost my esteem
The Pro Era crew recruitin'
And them fiends by the boat load
Nigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal
They don't feel the name
But they say that music dope though
Fuck it that's how it's supposed to go
These bloggers too emotional
They'll be postin' you
Until labels start Interscopin' you
By then it's Wale
And I'll be chillin' where I lay
Cause I rather see the top
Than to be livin' where I lay

Sometimes I feel alienated
Because I'm not up in this alien plant
Or on the radio sayin'
Fuck 'em: broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em
But always find my self back at the backanadian
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop
But I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been stackin this skill
Although my passion is real
I'm too cool to cash in the feel
When I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger
That affected my hunger
Got older in number
Realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin'
These motherfucka's faces
These ain't fear races
They just let the fit erase us
Adopted by the slum
Son of cards this is how they raped us
Yo son we gotta raise up
Don't let them just array us
'Till we raisins in the sun
So we gotta wake up

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent
Apex on the vertex
And I'm with seven serpents

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

Got a whole bunch of shit up on my plate now
Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I don't know who to believe
Or who to deceive
Got me thinkin' I
Sold my soul and they received a receipt
But I won't proceed to retreat
Jigga told me watch your thrown seat
And now I sees it
And the respect to big
I gotta cease it
And I hope he see me
Cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents
They ain't fit for this green
They just caesar salad
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us
It's the axis of the earth at the birth
I found a new balance
And now I walk on water just like I knew balance just like a relative
Marijuana sedatives got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the senate is
Cause they corruptin' the youth
We ain't inductin' the truth
Lookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to you

I passed the dutch to left and it started to make sense
It's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bent
You've been warned on the wrist to take a sit on top
Been on clock
Cause you could see that I been on watch
It don't stop
'Till you make the sacrifices
Trainin' was priceless to ices and devices
When the light switch I shift like I'm typin'
Livin' in the era where christ is the crisis
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans
But the mic is in my hands so I faild the booth
The blacker the berry is the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards
To the power of truth
Became flowers from roots
And now we just move in cahoots
I move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphalt
Every night I ask lord if this what I asked for

It all started with this patch reheard
And after that it came the sexual worst
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played body and I collide
With the vibe when I'm inside the walls
I cut my dotties on the side
'Cause I decide that she all mine's
I keep her in my eyes all the times
Not because I don't trust her
I just can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes
Because of her, she played the hustle up
And I'm like mad 'cause most
Man swammin love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up a lime man I swear I'm addicted, but
It's all cool 'cause when I lie for ya I fool
They say men lie and women lay naked that's all for me
Don't be so mad after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at the first sight
If you ask me and not the stupid analogy
Makes it cover flaws in the female anatomy

But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front though
I got some weed and some front though
(Don't front)
Hey you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Check
(Don't front)

It's like a massacre when less occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on locks on pass away
I sat you heard sit back observe
That she make me feel good
Is all I ask of her
And the clouds they would've known
We would've crash and burn
I pray long and hard
Hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her
But I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick a rub long before I lust to touch
But know I really even see it,
Everybody hurt not even the Lord
Force that we can keep up
If you don't wanna know start campin on the love
Everytime that we would kick it
I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Begged her at her friends, but home then I would take her
Didn't know that she was a hoe
That only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind was just relaxed
Could've been the high time because I swore we were a match in
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exhert the finest smell
You try to find it, I follow a trail
She left a few all other aside off the jail
That's all a part of the tale

But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front though
I got some weed and some front though
(Don't front)
Hey you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Check
(Don't front)

Hey yo don't tell me be patient
With no doctor prescription
Emotionally pretentious
And provocative figures
Should've known you missed a note
Like the eye would switch it
Remember hate the game
But she spot in some glitches
It's a simulation yeah
It's demolation
Take off your shirt
Let me feel manipulated
My heart like in Himalayas
But yeah I got the slayer
I'm crushing on you sweetheart
But yeah I'm a player
Sort 'em like I see 'em
Baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to so my
Nothing is useable

We all try when you go by
We all hide, trush is
I'm never home
And I'm calling that's where
The heart lies
So label me as heartless
There's nothing I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less
The insanity and alot stress
It put me in a state
They just started taking the tone on me
Kept the secrets from me
Kept emotions how I hold belief
Always kept the L so I know defeat
So everything will feel much better as soon
As you know I'll leave
Now sure if this is the less of me
You think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on
You know I'm coma, I'm in animal pause
But you got it off
When it flood I used to always feel like Noah
And I know I know her
Had this kind of skills I have to show her
I told her I'm the nigga
She seein' on the posters
Came back through
And I put it in the hostel
Just had to teach her one type
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though
Don't front
And tell your bitch don't front though
Don't front

I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was callin' me bad
I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga died he was playing a role
But now the niggas get their souls stole so often
They only did is offer gimits is awake in their coffin
From NY to cope it down the hole
She said that office offers abortions
Without precaution,
Power to the people,
There's too many who wanna be Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune story
Too many wanna be actors instead of achiveing their masters
At least the bachelor would know too many wanna be rappers
That's just statistics they'll be steak before he'll pay Christ
Like niggas in the White House supplying white towels
Or Jim Crow Laws you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you tryin' to fight for your existence

It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ

Person, mad nervous you surrender of the sturving
Look them in the eyes flicks makes you die
You know you merk 'em right there
Plus his hide is like right here
So you know that if you would fight fair
Then you'd have him like cry scared
But don't forget to tack your heart
By your right hand
So listen loud and clear
You don't wanna lose your life there
Don't you show a slight tail
Or let 'em sight fear
Just let 'em dissapear in the night yeah
What your life is, rabbi the clack is
Left alone in the apartment
Someone's been jobless someone make dollars
Shaking it topless and
Daddy be gone said it
Took off like ashes
Dizzy gain knowledge
I'm keeping it with the synapsis
Saying shit like that make you wish you were adopted
To escape the pain you joined the gang
And get intoxicated
Had no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
The only thing is you do with the game

It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ

Imagine me fed up
A go getter, for more cheddar
Pour never, no more lettuce
'Cause I know no better
No error no steals
No Kirk, No Lee, no school
No OJ, no talent, know me
But if I did say act right
What if I pack crack white
With my sack tight
Joined the gang fight
They click clack tight
Sledding the vibe
With the black stripe
And get my friend's the back knife
'Cause that's life
Nigga

It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this

Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ

Let's get down tonight
I think I might blow a whole pound tonight
So shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alright
Then you know I'm in the house
Let a nigga run his mouth
It's going down on sight
I'm always down to fight
[?] a nigga in the wild no bluff
Ain't no chuch when you're living in the wild
I was hidden in the crowd
Rippin' on some loud
'Till I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style
Wow must've been the material linen
Whole night kept him in my peripheral vision
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him
Word to my pops I know niggas known for cereal killin'
But back to the women
They tryna catch me slippin'
So I gotta pack a mags to stop venereal venoms
From entering my system
If it ain't my moms or my 'sistant
I cut 'em in the system

So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
Tell me where it's at and I'm in that spot (we got a lot to come true)
Let me know

Yo let me tell you what I'm living like
Same shit just a different night
Super bad chicks and they all up in my kryptonite
'Bout to get down
I'm tryna get up in the tight
So roll the endo right
And I can show you what them bitches like
They just wanna come and have fun
Told this little hun she could come
But don't touch my funds
I might get crazy
I might bust a gun
So just give me some money
And I might bust her son
Might bust and run
They said love will come knockin' at my door
Well I guess lust must've wrung
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on
Had her beggin' for the dawn 'till the crack of dawn
Then I passed it off to Quan
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank
Cause some pull hoes like
Hold up
Let me pull ove'
Told her to hop in then put it back and drove
And hit it out park like Al Pujols

She's so enticing
Derogatory thoughts when I'm sighting
Slangs to get her wet
And I heard you're overflowing I could test the waters like sea man
And I heard you like sea man (semen)
Well let me slide through I know you're feelin' the kid
Cause these nonchalant lines is lettin' me in
Cause on contrast
I could see us lovebirds it's in plain sight
And am I right cause I heard you like the international lovin'
On a higher scale
When I mean scale I do it well
Let me go deeper feel like I'm doing it well
Word on the street you acting like a bastard
Can I be you daddy?
You can hop up in my caddy
And I heard you got the fatty
Yeah cellurite
Just remember it's amazing how I come up on the track
So duck and weave
And please believe
My side effect is shakin' knees
Damn here I go again with the suggestive themes

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

Startin' blazin', and star gazin'
And see how you can reach your farthest aspiration
It's like holy matrimony in The Matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a 47 with' a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try hide divine intention
It's like, let 'em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life hands you lemons it's time to eliminate
More aside with' a lemonade anyways
Different days different highs different haze
Kama Sutra with' miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her she a vibrant thang

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

You niggas is suspect and I'm just a roughneck
That wasn't breakin' pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet she gettin' rough sex no Sunset
I like a chick with' a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too
I keep my eye they sus' too
Never tell 'em our goverment
Make any covenants
Bitches be lovin' it
See not to put a glove on it
Funny shit, you must've thought
I was a dumby miss
I feed lies to felines
Just to get up any time he's quick
Ye you got tricks but I got 5 more
So any game you trying to play you better
Know, I got the high score
You better settle down 'cause you not on my level now
The pro's is in my circle
They could tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns what this shit about
They used to doubt now they see 'em sprout
And I'm out

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight

When I was 13 I was bad
Rapping 'bout guns we never had
Now we smoke holes are float to tips
Old homies talking shit
Say you got what's best of mom
You stay platinum on that dime
Thought we was cool before
And we gonna take your ass on tour
Fuck nah, this much as to get
How you entitled to my shine
Nigga you ain't helped me get it
Now these niggas seen me gettin' it
Checking the statements from my debit
My profile get requested
But I never hit accept
Hits the sigh on to the chest
I reflect
When I was 14 our blazed eyes
Glued to the sampless screen
Eyes beam, 'cause we can make it better
Smoking on that jack era
Welcome to the progressive era

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Cause I deserve my respect
And brains don't matter

But tell me what really matters
When you pissed off at the world
Like you got a crazy bladder and
Momma always said that shit
Don't come on silver platter
So I gather my thoughts
And made use of all these synonyms
'Cause I could never swallow the truth
Like it's cinnamon excuse me if I'm militant
The cinnamon in my hood could leave a nigga
Quivering like God damn the living
And the venom in his liver is
Corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a stand still
So tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart
Still seem to be simmering
I'll take that little simmer and
Turn to an adrenaline
Penicillin cannot stop the drive
He be giving 'em like
Mad fords for fast forward
Let's get to the part
Where his records could afford
Him a couple of fords
Like Lord
Any gift at christmas just doesn't fit him
I need my own holiday
And by the way
I'm possibly on monopoly
And own all Donalds property
'Cause I won't live in poverty
Like

In the clouds come and find me
So I'm flying to Hermione
Homie tripping got 'em soundin' like
Hanson in the '90's
Charlie Manson, yo her body
'Cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out
So get your wish and count
You sell me something
Then I flip that amount
I just switched that account
Get that profit then I'm out yeah
They all wonder
But it's Nyck bitch no doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm vibin', ring the siren
With these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no licence
Hard, man I'm feeling like a Spartan
With a trident down
Picture perfect
But I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot
No Louisiana purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one
Catch a fair smack
I hunt upon my prey
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today
Like be afraid

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight

Cool cuts flow
The deli can't touch this
Slipping like fishes
Choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke
But I let the weed blow
Anything just let the leaves know
Oh, suckers fuck around
Get clap before you risk that
Nigga sayin' you crackin'
Fabric of your imagination
Ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find
Sex in these verses
But I got your attention
It's part of my ascension
But if I keep totin'
This chant is gonna leave me stranded
In this dimension, but to mention
Niggas is snitchin', might charge me with battery
But fuck that 'cause piss was never in your anatomy
So don't try to line a nigga
That got mine on my third eye shit

Suspect niggas don't come outside

And they see we getting love
'Cause they see the pros is winning
'Cause we giving love back
So they peeping how we fittin'
And gonna have to tuss nigga step into me
I like to keep my chakras open
So respect my G
I got the bush going in
Rapping FPT
So sus' niggas watch your back pros next to me
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green
And show these suspect niggas what they mean to scheme
Another Apex predator crushing your dreams

Taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene

Never in my vex
I'm always calm, cool, collect
Unless you disrespect
I wreck you verbally
So expect the worst from me
I deck you with my intellect
You best be circumspect check
Made you making all the wrong moves
Why intimidate you, I more infuriate you
'Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gold
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see
Come sneak a peak and tell me what you peepin'
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seein'
It is what here sits in the midst of us
Yea quite mysterious, no you're not delirious
I'm serious, it's clear to us
Add some crystal gonna see gold than platinum
Set it on the tarots before
So I know how it is all
Gonna go down
Gotta go more uptown
More on the cloud
'Cause didn't you know by now
I'm skyline bound
And my time's now
I don't graze ground
I'm new in your town
So assume what you please
But you don't know me
Say what you please

Who that mofo that came to show boat
It's 'cause he flow like no other
Styles mood his brother
And slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on track ain't a real test
The real quest, is making real tracks
With feelings people ain't feel yet
Deadly be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records
I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking
For beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line up
The bars that I could line up
Could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge
Rap is in my blood so much
My capillaries adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January
Every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times
Than my school's lunch line
So if this hit's mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty da' vocals recorded spit shine

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside

'Til the day I die
I'll be puffin' la
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell 'em government spies
I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move
'Cause I done move like a coward
Knowledge is power
And the flower of life is ours
Get his eyes hours
Maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind
And maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential
In our body and soul
Prolly you know
I found mines right through the pencil
Started body and flow
But fuck that
There's been a preview of primeval
Hip hop retrieval, I hold it legal
Like I'm coppers so weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top
No redo, thinking up evil but see no evil
Just because
'Cause I didn't ask to be this good
They just made me better
They told me cheese at the camps
And they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three bass, 2 Pac
But he only made one 'era
The era

Suspect niggas don't come outside
