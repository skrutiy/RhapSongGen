 
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hoping that you'll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that

We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home

Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'

Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is bullshit, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

I'mma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
(Aye aye nigga what's happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga)
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer
What the fuck happened?
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
(A two man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say...

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

You goat mouth mammy fucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo
Ah yeah fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king

Bitch where was you when I was walkin'-

(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)

Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence

What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me

Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down

And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...

And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it

If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I'm not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I'm just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

If these walls could talk they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved I'd rather diss them
I'd rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon' crush

If your walls could talk they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

Loving you is complicated

I place blame when you still
Place shame when you still
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame him for
Nigga I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience
Where was your antennas, where was the influence you speak of
You preached in front of 100, 000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me
Yes I hate you too

And you the reason why mama and them leavin'
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover, well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed"
You ain't try

I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk [gulp] I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you [gulp] I'm bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go"
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like yah
Bad trips like "God!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright

What you want, you a house you a car
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black, on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs I write till I'm right with God

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

What's wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible too

My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know

I remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
I said oh no, not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said this to me
I remember what you said too you said
My name is Lucy Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I don't do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy Give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that's possible

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home

Oh shit!
Oh, I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
That sloppy

This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black (Pendleton) ball cap
(West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym fall back
(West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don't gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it's worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn't know shit
The day I came home

I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home

This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere

I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail.
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga.
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don't fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, it's set trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin'
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera back at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
â€œK. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's boxâ€�
I box â€˜em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one

How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump 6, dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for 10 Rand [apprrox $1 USD], stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"

I wash my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs

Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it

Let me talk my Stu Scott, â€˜scuse me on my 2pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
And forcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' â€œWoohah!â€�
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain't talkin' Jay, I ain't talkin' Bey
I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike yourself esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing

Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?
I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth

Everything black, I don't want black
I want everything black, I ain't need black
Some white some black, I ain't mean black
I want everything black

Six in the mornin', fire in the street
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie you made me
Black don't crack my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you â€” no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

What do you got to offer?
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:

I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

(Crazy)
(What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

Huh (Walk my bare feet) huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) huh (fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) huh (My heart undone) one, two, three

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit
Pause, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left â€˜em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman, a blind woman pacin' up and down the sidewalk.
She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it.
So after watching her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something.
I would like to help you find it. She replied, "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life"

Is it wickedness?

Views on police brutality with that line in the song quote, "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fosho... I don't like it"

I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yashua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate and off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA

See you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
That don't exist, born outside a jellyfish at age
See my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front shit
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Baller's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, anti-social, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a crown and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' ham
I'm dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eatin' 4 dollar brats, wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our fate
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA

I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah

Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage

See me on the TV and scream, "That's Uncle Kendrick"
Yeah, that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'ma Israelite, don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin called Duckworth
Said, "Know my worth"
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me

I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow
Fuck the world
The world is ending, I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my daughter compromised and jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right?
Shit, I feel like

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debated on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me, look
I feel like I can't breathe, look
I feel like I can't sleep, look
I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin'
Fillin' the planks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill up with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin', but nothin' is awkward
The feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic
I feel like I'm boxin' demons, monsters
False prophets schemin', sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a lochness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say some, I feel like take some
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight just get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)

It's a secret society, all we ask is trust (all we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Kung Fu Kenny, now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave's not defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

Bad gyal RiRi, now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like a CD in
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane, been a bad bitch
Way before any cash came, I'm established
Hundred carats on my name, run the atlas
I'm a natural, I'm alright

I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long I slowed
I done came down so hard I slowed
I don't sleep forever, all a real nigga won't

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want is tonight is just to get high up (yeah)
(all I want is, all I want is)

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? it is fame? It is weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your women or your man?
Do it end with your family and friends? 
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want is tonight is just to get high up
(All I want is, all I want is)

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
All I know is I'm trying
All I know is I'm dying
Baby

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and

It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care

Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make a band, I understand
I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around, this time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care

Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care

Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

Aye, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with sum counterfeits
But now I'm countin this
Parmesan where my accountant lives in fact I'm down at this
Dusse with my boo bae, tastes like kool aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down we playin tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m. funk
Piss out your per diem you jus gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your bm I still ride mercedes, funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano c, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know... bitch be humble

Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't' right

Show me something natural like afro on richard pryor
Show me something natural like ass with some stretchmarks

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
That blood rush my favorite thing
Heart beat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
It's okay
She said it's okay

Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new, new shit
This that new, new shit

Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Maybe some cakes and make you
Door in his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, hol' up
Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club, or your mama house
Whatever you doin' just make it count
I need some water
Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touchin' yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
That blood rush my favorite thing
Heart beat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
It's okay
She said it's okay

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did, what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money, call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a F and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried and the feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stealed and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Think they agree, parade the streets with your voice profit
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs
Stuck in our ways, drones

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
That blood rush my favorite thing
Heart beat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
It's okay
She said it's okay

Pick up the phone, call me babe

Bad attitude for your nanny
Curvin' your hit from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera

Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away

If didn't ride blade on curve, would you still (love me)

America, God bless you if it's good to you
America please take my hand
Can you help me underst..

Throw a steak off the yacht to a pool full of sharks he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you something woah
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like bitch I did that x-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (no more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin
God bless America you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphin' on what the lord had done
He said, "K-Dot can you pray for me? It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"
He was lookin' for some closure hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better but I told him
"I can't sugar coat the answer for you, this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son, that mean that somebody's gettin' killed"
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "bitch I did that"
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back

It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
It's murder on my street
Y'all street, back streets
Wall street, corporate offices, banks
Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin' or you married to blood?
I'll ask again, oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
Americas reflections of me
That's what a mirror does

It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

I don't think I can find a way to make it on this earth
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, why don't you burn this mufucka?

I beat yo' ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house with tears in your eyes
Runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Kiesha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up, I beat yo' ass
You better not run to your father, I beat yo' ass
You know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I can smoke fear away, I roll that motherfucker up
And then I take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

Think I can prolly find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die 'cause these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're seventeen
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now, now

When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment and will he see me and show up?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is it advisin' somebody that's holdin' my checks?
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
And I can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap

This what God feel like, yeah
Laughing to the bank like aha, yeah
Flex on swole like aha, yeah
You feel some type of way then, aha, yeah

Every since a young man
All I want to be was a gunman
Shooting up the charts, better, run man
Ya'll gotta see that I won man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger ways, work at JT
Handle balls like a fade, watch me work at JT
I'm at large, running plays like a circuit, JT
I'm selling verses, Jay Z, watch me work at JT
Look, look, hold up
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young fucking all the rats
Don't judge me, aiming at your head for a stack
Don't judge me
Don't judge me, now my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me, if I press your line, you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend ya'll gon' see

This what God feel like, yeah
Laughing to the bank like aha, yeah
Flex on swole like aha, yeah
You feel some type of way then, aha, yeah

Fuck is you talking to?
Aye, do you know who you talking to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get your ass killed by the finest
Everything life is a gamble
Nothing in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift, I'm on
I ain't sorry for it, ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitate, ducking haters
Oh my, my heart is rich, my heart is famous

This what God feel like, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughing to the bank like aha (this what God feel like)
Yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like aha (this what God feel like)
Yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way then, aha (this what God feel like)
This what God feel like
Yeah (This what God feel like)
This what God feel like

It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember what happens on earth stays on earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

Darling I told you many times, and I am telling you once again
Just to remind you sweetheart that my..

Oh Lamar, hail Mary a marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
God is one funny mothafucka
The true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children listen, it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the niggas in garden projects the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven, well respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and joking made life easier
Hard times, momma on crack, and forty oh telling his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin' and bangin', he was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin', fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
He even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie
Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing
That's on the daily, saw his first mil twenty years old
Had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun
They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when they turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while the rats in the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See at this chicken spot there was this light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on and 500 dollars
They had a son hoping that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in '84, that's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works
Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious, prevalent proposition with nines
Ducky was well aware, they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas good sides, free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him, in fact it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time, reverse the manifest and good karma and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them strangers might make a meet again
And start recording studios where they reaping the benefits
Then they start reminding 'bout that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gun fight

So I was taking a walk the other day..

It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds is they limits cause we in 'em; eyes low
Squinted, more Ls but we winning acting like it's
Hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens
Remember those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ants, and it's only the beginning
Big pimpin', pull a dime, drop 'em for they innocence
Skate like mens' flow, sweet like cinnamon
He a child, but they treat him like a bigger man
Cause when the pen in his hand, he bake 'em up like he Jigga man
Know you see him in the mirror fam, the ones you say
You ain't hot but your biggest fan like, "Nigga, damn."
Before he got popular, he bit the man
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram
Got it with the grams, everybody say they dissed a fan
Know the haters too jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam
It's the fuckin' jam

Yea
You remember back in the days when you used to rocks waves and shit
When like...yo I had the fucking 360 my nigga
Like nobody in the hood was fucking my shit
And that's real shit

Since nine five, momma been working nine five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs, and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I'm hopeful that me spittin it soulful will have me in the Daily Postal
Flying coastal eatin tofu
Like I told you I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than descendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin â€œwhat happened?"
I'm back to the chapter
Momma told me follow dreams and never have to ask her, to
So that's what I do, became an MC master
Since then it's been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask em "Who is Joey Bad?"
Watch em grasp, asthma, damn it's so sad
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found it your retinal
And they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north, speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless it was some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes

What, what the rap audience ain't ready for, is a real person
You know what I wanna say, a real N-I-G-G-A. I'm comin' at 'em a hundred percent real. I ain't compromisin' nothin'
Anybody that talk about me got problems. You know what I'm sayin'? It's gon' be straight up like if I was a street person.
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world, and I'm bein' real about it and I'mma grow wit' my music

Yeah, but it's far from over
Won't stop til' I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
Til' I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like super novas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like 3 times, have 3 kids, I hope
Me & wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge cuz yeah, they 'gon need it
Cuz when my fam tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that the advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, our punishments they grew more crucial
So use the word brutal, cuz my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attracts the likes of even Madlib
Go call a mansion and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine

Imagine

I'mma make it all happen

My man Dirty had to boot it
Just to put me in my right mind
I rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines
Siked dimes a slice, closed eyes
I'm sliced so by, why you ain't to go
That given thrown so by
Laugh it out by the pole light
Show Shorty to the back room
Place your race she acting like a vacuum
Showed her to the door before the afternoon
She fell hard on the floor
So you know that she'll be back soon
Fake MC get their raps wrong
Young villans up upon a track
And the track doom, click clack boom
Ressurect and boom back from the tomb
Drags dope like crack in cocoons
Back in this move, back on the move
It's the motherfucking real, nigga, chill, act cool
Pay respect to the cat drew
And I'm way too blessed
To be dough with shots, that's true

Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realer

I'm trying to find my own lane
In this freeway life
Just remember homeboy
It ain't no free way to life
My nigga has gone haas
Tryin' not to lose his soul
'Til the rims holes are gone
'Cause once the devil drive on
That nigga ain't letting go
And I'm far from religious
I just know right and wrong
I know how to write these songs
I know how to light these bongs
I know how to rip thongs
And I'm pretty good and being bald
Nigga, I'm so crazy, Nigga I'm loco gased up
Like Scirocco pressed the pedal to the floor
But you out the door
Bitch loved it in here, no more
'Cause I weave low, faking in a Louie bag
Weap chick I tried to back, 'cause she had the nerve
To turn me down, heard the song and turned around
Now she want me to enter her pants
But I'm gone bitch, missed your chance

Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer

I got sick in class started making classics
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and, bus asses
I'm sure they'll blow like bust acid
Puff acids, like Mav' chuchu Maverick
And I'm average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit but you still can't pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescence, they be having rapping secession's over adding lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I'm trying to multiply
Monopolies and tax the homies, then divide the cheese
Divide lexus to resize the lease
So my eyes could see through the ease
Shown you all how about decease
A part of see, after asses like apostrophes
You can't stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part of the cheese, head at the spot and leave
Apologies for apology

Joey Bad and Chuck Strangers
Leaving niggas in danger
Joey Bad, leaving niggas in danger

It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

Niggas don't want war I'm a martian with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel writing intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyns the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay so,
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wall like they lightyear, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit out to inaugurate
My P.E conglomerates bout to P-E-E on any wanna B-E, weak MC
Here I'm out to leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go:
{Ba boom Ba boom Ba boom boom Ba boom}
Hispanic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that K
Like every day in every way and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is pray
Cause when niggas start equipin'
And throw the clip in
Your blood drippin'
And got you slippin'
Under the victim, don't know what's hit them
Through his spinal, just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like you're so right
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E, Public Enemy, Assassinator, bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything son
Fuck government, Fuck, listenin' and shit

You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

There's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they use to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards
Wiping out motherboards
Started spitting fire cause my motherfuckin lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
With a mind of finest interests for your finest interests
They say hard work pays off, well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
Cause P.E's about to take off, with protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous, finger to the president screamin' "fuck censorship! "
If Obama got that president election then them P.E boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan and pokemon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin Uzi's cause it's given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man try and disrespect it, send a message and it's over in a mili second
Nigga

I'm a beast with these flows
2 birds one stone, you get geese when trees roll
They say I'm evil cause I trained my eagle to see gold
See, no seagulls couldn't see these goals
Please, it's the return of the beast coast
No cash, flash put the cheese still make teeth show
The cold needle, is how you move on a strip, you trynna be Vito?, well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, ya'll ain't real spitters, ya'll lips chapped
Better watch the Mr. Nicewatch, don't risk/wrist that
I got a 6 pack of bear/bare skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (THAT SHIT CRAY!)
Ya'll niggas softspoken, down below token
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
It makes sense you want beef with this frozen
It nuts for new school, in the tool, ya' kid hold him
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico
A lyrical spanish, with a dance that's demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu standin'
Ain't no half steppin' 'round me
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
That young cop killer, I'm dat I'll, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer

Soul searchin' 'till my flows are perfect
I ain't trynna be a slave to grow old from workin'
Sorry BADA$$, you lucky that I peeped the second
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection
Check the melody, it's so heavenly
That shit'll get your hips to move no 70's
All the Opium, can I bust soliloquies
Got that shit mix and mastered both remedies
Grab a spoonful, sturrin' up a pot
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot
I'm flowin' like a volcano, drippin' verses while drippin' verses off the top
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my genes, don't worry where my pants is
Get with the script it's that ignorant shit
And they bound to get sick off of this quick
But I sealin' my lips, it's a shift
I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberries it's a jam
So throw up both hands if you can
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit
Until they bury me, my volume is going in depth with longevity

Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wildin'
He look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glarin' signs
The sympathy zippity
Only thing plain is the mad violence
No lyin' niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn ya molecules until you let go ions
Sleep beef like they let go lions
So don't eye em' they get the wrong message
Wrong message put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me boy dress up I'm givin' too many lectures
And I'm puttin' in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like they gon' catch up fuck what you must heard
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listenin' to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressin' and shine, define

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Just got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and what not
The motto never changed it's still fuck cops
We went from havin' lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs is hot whenever we puff pot
We touch blocks and end up havin a gut shot
But fuck that, ain't tryna live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can't be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your fade is your only escape
Fuck a priest's opinion
Knock the hinges off of Heaven's gates
Tryna share my cells with' my mate
Not share a cell with' mates
Wreckin' shit with' my wrecklessness
The L get lit that's when I start second guessin' shit
Thinkin' 'bout Tot and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could've fuck me over
Never nigga guess again
I'm street so cross me like pedestrians
And that's gon be your end of it
Straight revokin' your membership

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kid
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna know what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Niggas wanna know what I'm about
I'm bout blowin' loud on the block sporty
GLOCK 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out
Commission with' my composition
Who the kid spittin' behind the bars
Like a con position
Gotta give 'em time to listen
They'll soon bump to it they'll like me
I kick it like Nike they'll adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain't mad at you I keep my attitude on school
Learn ya bucks to do it
I'm out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me
Who the bestest MC?
They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molestin' the beat
Fuck math, teachers shoul teach
If it keep Smith & Wesson's off the street
So first class be a lesson from me
Fuck what you teach if it's a riggies
I fly it over liggies
All time highs where Jesus can't reach us
Step to me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers
Hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot
GLOCK cocked watchin' out for cops
All about they cheddar
Youngins know nothin' that's better
Like fuck a prison letter
Those Beretta's led us to the lettuce
Real as fetishes menaces
Want the senator's percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemisis
Smokin' on the Clematis
Get open like a present is
Now yo presence is on the premisces for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linkin terrorists from the Stuy
Then linkin terraces
They on that wrecker shit
They leave you left for the dead
Kids don't play they'll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slingin' some reds
Poppin' some meds
Shits be so deep in cover they be chasin' the feds
I be back stage grippin' haze breakin' my leg
My folks was makin' the best
When they was naked in bed, muthafucka

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Aye yo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow?
Point 'em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?

Check!

Puffing stramonium underground like pieholes
Look on their flasshole
These bars like writing espressioni
And these folks are for custodians
Homeless man only goldregen do
Risin' at my laptop looking at
Ref on opium truth
They like to throw you in room
I'm like if only you knew
I'm only in school for cosmology
That's why I act as lonely as you
You see I'm wise behind my years and my past
And my voice over the stairs
Is the only way they hear
With a copy on my membrane
But I've been smoking chem strain
So lately I've been having hard times
With remembering
And be patient, my flood is proving
Gipsies ain't shit
'Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix
But fuck it I'm a rap it momma likely and adequitly
'Til I drove into static with my slimatic anatomy
And come out into in PD with fugitives at blue prison hill mad is
I've been going roll, this shit's how I feel rappin'
You get y'all serve chapters so I can't even guess this
We taught you how to be proten but still it's acting in messes
Y'all better get back your asses
'Cause we 'bout to annihilate
My empire gate seem the Empire State
I'm on now on your platform
Look at the way they clap for 'em
Never fuck with funny man
'Cause I don't like my back tone
Nigga ain't squat, diss that top
You ain't used too
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through
No beef like nunu's
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through
I tell 'em
No beef like nunu's
It's world domination, nation
You're tuned in to my station
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top
With my fucking world domination, nation
You're tuned in to my station
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top
With my fucking team

Yeah
Another love song gone wrong
So know you are a WOOP
Like based God in wonton
But I didn't
And I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball
But I'm still glad I hit it
'Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know
Coulda shoulda type like,
"Oh, it was like, too tight"
Come on, I would've pipe
But our schedules contradicted
Well I was tied down hey pipe down
First night ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown
And whipped out the slanky
Then she screamed, "Joey spank me"
And after that she even thanked me, swanky
One time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we'll be kicking rhymes
'Til the end of time
But back to the topic
Oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off
And wondering why shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga
Do miss the lip gloss
Now she sucked some next nigga dick off
And my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm posed to do
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent the postcards so you know it's true
I promise that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you frontin like you don't miss my whole cock
Pit down your esophagus
Screaming, "daddy stop it"
Ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polish in the scratches of my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky roll
And I tried to suck your titties whole
For milk for my cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came
I hit that spot twice and since then
You haven't been the same
Now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name
But my first impression: what a lame
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with a shoulder stain
Faggot
Six months, and I'm still at it
You probably never hear this track
But I still rap it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you to not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and it's kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't be reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah

Words to my mother
Two things I never do
Is leave the crib without some rubbers
Or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get
A brother caught up
In this sticky situation
Missing menstruation
Cycles, they all psycho
Ask Michael
Before you give a note
For Billie Jean's and the nice clothes
Like woo don't let them trap you
On the tight rope with spike holes
In the condom to form a zygote over night
Ask Quan he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch
I knew this rap shit
And put it over life
On the coldest nights
And shine like the solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases pipe
Chicks in to weirdest places
From roof tops, to staircases
Like get a load on their faces
Face it if you fear hate it
You get put it on this girls face

I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin

Hey yo, I'm attached too, to the cash rules
Bout to go nuts niggas get their attitudes
To these cash you
Who you know that cool that they drip swagoo
And I'm here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga that's the second time
I passed you, eating my gas fume
Got me thinking I could gas you
And your girl got gas too
She let me tackle before I touch and I staple
And as you decide to put her shackle
I'm that dude, fuck values
Pump up the volume, all up in the cut
No alchool just bad booze
Tryin to find the path to bring him back too
Like a taboo, that poo, got back chicks
That I feel bad for
Loosing 'til they back bones
Look it at my cock tip
Down and doin' all no matter what the synapsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
And all your conscience tap exclusively vodka and shit

I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They could never catch me slippin
I don't trust these bitches
They would never catch me slippin
Slipping
They would never catch me slippin

From the block to the top
Budha baggies in a sock
Only thing that changed now
Is we ain't runnin' out of stock
Use to beg mom dukes for lunch money
Honies used to run from me
When pockets was dust bunnies
Now what's funny
Is when done came up and conquered
Even the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers
Though them gangstas grill
I tell 'em keep that drama away
Don't fuck with thieves
I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape
They launchin' out straights
I'm tryin' not to get sprayed
Whether it's spitter or a quiter behind the trigger
Approachin' his prey his eyes bigger
Won't stop to consider what's right or wrong
Because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver

But that's just daily routine
The streets is couped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth
Niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you can think you cool with yo nice things
Get wiped cleaned for ice cream when the light speed

Traded in my Nikes for a new mic
I guess it's safe to say
He sold soles for his new life
Like they were tryna blind us
But we know the true designer
They didn't wanna see us find the diviners
So now we hit the vines
Up day and night on the regular
I know my momma prayin'
Like she want me reach my aims in life
But just stay in sight
So I'm shootin' for my dreams
Hit the booth and it boost my esteem
The Pro Era crew recruitin'
And them fiends by the boat load
Nigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal
They don't feel the name
But they say that music dope though
Fuck it that's how it's supposed to go
These bloggers too emotional
They'll be postin' you
Until labels start Interscopin' you
By then it's Wale
And I'll be chillin' where I lay
Cause I rather see the top
Than to be livin' where I lay

Sometimes I feel alienated
Because I'm not up in this alien plant
Or on the radio sayin'
Fuck 'em: broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em
But always find my self back at the backanadian
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop
But I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been stackin this skill
Although my passion is real
I'm too cool to cash in the feel
When I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger
That affected my hunger
Got older in number
Realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin'
These motherfucka's faces
These ain't fear races
They just let the fit erase us
Adopted by the slum
Son of cards this is how they raped us
Yo son we gotta raise up
Don't let them just array us
'Till we raisins in the sun
So we gotta wake up

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent
Apex on the vertex
And I'm with seven serpents

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

Got a whole bunch of shit up on my plate now
Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I don't know who to believe
Or who to deceive
Got me thinkin' I
Sold my soul and they received a receipt
But I won't proceed to retreat
Jigga told me watch your thrown seat
And now I sees it
And the respect to big
I gotta cease it
And I hope he see me
Cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents
They ain't fit for this green
They just caesar salad
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us
It's the axis of the earth at the birth
I found a new balance
And now I walk on water just like I knew balance just like a relative
Marijuana sedatives got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the senate is
Cause they corruptin' the youth
We ain't inductin' the truth
Lookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to you

I passed the dutch to left and it started to make sense
It's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bent
You've been warned on the wrist to take a sit on top
Been on clock
Cause you could see that I been on watch
It don't stop
'Till you make the sacrifices
Trainin' was priceless to ices and devices
When the light switch I shift like I'm typin'
Livin' in the era where christ is the crisis
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans
But the mic is in my hands so I faild the booth
The blacker the berry is the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards
To the power of truth
Became flowers from roots
And now we just move in cahoots
I move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphalt
Every night I ask lord if this what I asked for

It all started with this patch reheard
And after that it came the sexual worst
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played body and I collide
With the vibe when I'm inside the walls
I cut my dotties on the side
'Cause I decide that she all mine's
I keep her in my eyes all the times
Not because I don't trust her
I just can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes
Because of her, she played the hustle up
And I'm like mad 'cause most
Man swammin love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up a lime man I swear I'm addicted, but
It's all cool 'cause when I lie for ya I fool
They say men lie and women lay naked that's all for me
Don't be so mad after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at the first sight
If you ask me and not the stupid analogy
Makes it cover flaws in the female anatomy

But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front though
I got some weed and some front though
(Don't front)
Hey you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Check
(Don't front)

It's like a massacre when less occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on locks on pass away
I sat you heard sit back observe
That she make me feel good
Is all I ask of her
And the clouds they would've known
We would've crash and burn
I pray long and hard
Hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her
But I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick a rub long before I lust to touch
But know I really even see it,
Everybody hurt not even the Lord
Force that we can keep up
If you don't wanna know start campin on the love
Everytime that we would kick it
I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Begged her at her friends, but home then I would take her
Didn't know that she was a hoe
That only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind was just relaxed
Could've been the high time because I swore we were a match in
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exhert the finest smell
You try to find it, I follow a trail
She left a few all other aside off the jail
That's all a part of the tale

But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front though
I got some weed and some front though
(Don't front)
Hey you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Check
(Don't front)

Hey yo don't tell me be patient
With no doctor prescription
Emotionally pretentious
And provocative figures
Should've known you missed a note
Like the eye would switch it
Remember hate the game
But she spot in some glitches
It's a simulation yeah
It's demolation
Take off your shirt
Let me feel manipulated
My heart like in Himalayas
But yeah I got the slayer
I'm crushing on you sweetheart
But yeah I'm a player
Sort 'em like I see 'em
Baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to so my
Nothing is useable

We all try when you go by
We all hide, trush is
I'm never home
And I'm calling that's where
The heart lies
So label me as heartless
There's nothing I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less
The insanity and alot stress
It put me in a state
They just started taking the tone on me
Kept the secrets from me
Kept emotions how I hold belief
Always kept the L so I know defeat
So everything will feel much better as soon
As you know I'll leave
Now sure if this is the less of me
You think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on
You know I'm coma, I'm in animal pause
But you got it off
When it flood I used to always feel like Noah
And I know I know her
Had this kind of skills I have to show her
I told her I'm the nigga
She seein' on the posters
Came back through
And I put it in the hostel
Just had to teach her one type
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though
Don't front
And tell your bitch don't front though
Don't front

I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was callin' me bad
I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga died he was playing a role
But now the niggas get their souls stole so often
They only did is offer gimits is awake in their coffin
From NY to cope it down the hole
She said that office offers abortions
Without precaution,
Power to the people,
There's too many who wanna be Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune story
Too many wanna be actors instead of achiveing their masters
At least the bachelor would know too many wanna be rappers
That's just statistics they'll be steak before he'll pay Christ
Like niggas in the White House supplying white towels
Or Jim Crow Laws you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you tryin' to fight for your existence

It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ

Person, mad nervous you surrender of the sturving
Look them in the eyes flicks makes you die
You know you merk 'em right there
Plus his hide is like right here
So you know that if you would fight fair
Then you'd have him like cry scared
But don't forget to tack your heart
By your right hand
So listen loud and clear
You don't wanna lose your life there
Don't you show a slight tail
Or let 'em sight fear
Just let 'em dissapear in the night yeah
What your life is, rabbi the clack is
Left alone in the apartment
Someone's been jobless someone make dollars
Shaking it topless and
Daddy be gone said it
Took off like ashes
Dizzy gain knowledge
I'm keeping it with the synapsis
Saying shit like that make you wish you were adopted
To escape the pain you joined the gang
And get intoxicated
Had no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
The only thing is you do with the game

It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ

Imagine me fed up
A go getter, for more cheddar
Pour never, no more lettuce
'Cause I know no better
No error no steals
No Kirk, No Lee, no school
No OJ, no talent, know me
But if I did say act right
What if I pack crack white
With my sack tight
Joined the gang fight
They click clack tight
Sledding the vibe
With the black stripe
And get my friend's the back knife
'Cause that's life
Nigga

It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ
It ain't easy living life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous
But know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices
High tech devices
So keep your tech down
Or meet your Christ

Let's get down tonight
I think I might blow a whole pound tonight
So shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alright
Then you know I'm in the house
Let a nigga run his mouth
It's going down on sight
I'm always down to fight
[?] a nigga in the wild no bluff
Ain't no chuch when you're living in the wild
I was hidden in the crowd
Rippin' on some loud
'Till I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style
Wow must've been the material linen
Whole night kept him in my peripheral vision
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him
Word to my pops I know niggas known for cereal killin'
But back to the women
They tryna catch me slippin'
So I gotta pack a mags to stop venereal venoms
From entering my system
If it ain't my moms or my 'sistant
I cut 'em in the system

So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
Tell me where it's at and I'm in that spot (we got a lot to come true)
Let me know

Yo let me tell you what I'm living like
Same shit just a different night
Super bad chicks and they all up in my kryptonite
'Bout to get down
I'm tryna get up in the tight
So roll the endo right
And I can show you what them bitches like
They just wanna come and have fun
Told this little hun she could come
But don't touch my funds
I might get crazy
I might bust a gun
So just give me some money
And I might bust her son
Might bust and run
They said love will come knockin' at my door
Well I guess lust must've wrung
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on
Had her beggin' for the dawn 'till the crack of dawn
Then I passed it off to Quan
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank
Cause some pull hoes like
Hold up
Let me pull ove'
Told her to hop in then put it back and drove
And hit it out park like Al Pujols

She's so enticing
Derogatory thoughts when I'm sighting
Slangs to get her wet
And I heard you're overflowing I could test the waters like sea man
And I heard you like sea man (semen)
Well let me slide through I know you're feelin' the kid
Cause these nonchalant lines is lettin' me in
Cause on contrast
I could see us lovebirds it's in plain sight
And am I right cause I heard you like the international lovin'
On a higher scale
When I mean scale I do it well
Let me go deeper feel like I'm doing it well
Word on the street you acting like a bastard
Can I be you daddy?
You can hop up in my caddy
And I heard you got the fatty
Yeah cellurite
Just remember it's amazing how I come up on the track
So duck and weave
And please believe
My side effect is shakin' knees
Damn here I go again with the suggestive themes

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

Startin' blazin', and star gazin'
And see how you can reach your farthest aspiration
It's like holy matrimony in The Matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a 47 with' a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try hide divine intention
It's like, let 'em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life hands you lemons it's time to eliminate
More aside with' a lemonade anyways
Different days different highs different haze
Kama Sutra with' miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her she a vibrant thang

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Cause I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

You niggas is suspect and I'm just a roughneck
That wasn't breakin' pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet she gettin' rough sex no Sunset
I like a chick with' a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too
I keep my eye they sus' too
Never tell 'em our goverment
Make any covenants
Bitches be lovin' it
See not to put a glove on it
Funny shit, you must've thought
I was a dumby miss
I feed lies to felines
Just to get up any time he's quick
Ye you got tricks but I got 5 more
So any game you trying to play you better
Know, I got the high score
You better settle down 'cause you not on my level now
The pro's is in my circle
They could tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns what this shit about
They used to doubt now they see 'em sprout
And I'm out

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Nigga I deserve my respect
And brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

When I was 13 I was bad
Rapping 'bout guns we never had
Now we smoke holes are float to tips
Old homies talking shit
Say you got what's best of mom
You stay platinum on that dime
Thought we was cool before
And we gonna take your ass on tour
Fuck nah, this much as to get
How you entitled to my shine
Nigga you ain't helped me get it
Now these niggas seen me gettin' it
Checking the statements from my debit
My profile get requested
But I never hit accept
Hits the sigh on to the chest
I reflect
When I was 14 our blazed eyes
Glued to the sampless screen
Eyes beam, 'cause we can make it better
Smoking on that jack era
Welcome to the progressive era

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Cause I deserve my respect
And brains don't matter

But tell me what really matters
When you pissed off at the world
Like you got a crazy bladder and
Momma always said that shit
Don't come on silver platter
So I gather my thoughts
And made use of all these synonyms
'Cause I could never swallow the truth
Like it's cinnamon excuse me if I'm militant
The cinnamon in my hood could leave a nigga
Quivering like God damn the living
And the venom in his liver is
Corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a stand still
So tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart
Still seem to be simmering
I'll take that little simmer and
Turn to an adrenaline
Penicillin cannot stop the drive
He be giving 'em like
Mad fords for fast forward
Let's get to the part
Where his records could afford
Him a couple of fords
Like Lord
Any gift at christmas just doesn't fit him
I need my own holiday
And by the way
I'm possibly on monopoly
And own all Donalds property
'Cause I won't live in poverty
Like

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

In the clouds come and find me
So I'm flying to Hermione
Homie tripping got 'em soundin' like
Hanson in the '90's
Charlie Manson, yo her body
'Cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out
So get your wish and count
You sell me something
Then I flip that amount
I just switched that account
Get that profit then I'm out yeah
They all wonder
But it's Nyck bitch no doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm vibin', ring the siren
With these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no licence
Hard, man I'm feeling like a Spartan
With a trident down
Picture perfect
But I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot
No Louisiana purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one
Catch a fair smack
I hunt upon my prey
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today
Like be afraid

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Cause I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

Cool cuts flow
The deli can't touch this
Slipping like fishes
Choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke
But I let the weed blow
Anything just let the leaves know
Oh, suckers fuck around
Get clap before you risk that
Nigga sayin' you crackin'
Fabric of your imagination
Ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find
Sex in these verses
But I got your attention
It's part of my ascension
But if I keep totin'
This chant is gonna leave me stranded
In this dimension, but to mention
Niggas is snitchin', might charge me with battery
But fuck that 'cause piss was never in your anatomy
So don't try to line a nigga
That got mine on my third eye shit

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Say I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

Man I'm on a higher degrees
Without my masters
I could use my word
To urge in a disasters
Niggas wanna know how my wheels keep on spinning
And they see we getting love
'Cause they see the pros is winning
'Cause we giving love back
So they peeping how we fittin'
And gonna have to tuss nigga step into me
I like to keep my chakras open
So respect my G
I got the bush going in
Rapping FPT
So sus' niggas watch your back pros next to me
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green
And show these suspect niggas what they mean to scheme
Another Apex predator crushing your dreams
Gonna get your wave pushed back between my cream
Taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene
I'm taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene
Taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

The P the R the O the Debt
Never in my vex
I'm always calm, cool, collect
Unless you disrespect
I wreck you verbally
So expect the worst from me
I deck you with my intellect
You best be circumspect check
Made you making all the wrong moves
Why intimidate you, I more infuriate you
'Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gold
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see
Come sneak a peak and tell me what you peepin'
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seein'
It is what here sits in the midst of us
Yea quite mysterious, no you're not delirious
I'm serious, it's clear to us
Add some crystal gonna see gold than platinum
Set it on the tarots before
So I know how it is all
Gonna go down
Gotta go more uptown
More on the cloud
'Cause didn't you know by now
I'm skyline bound
And my time's now
I don't graze ground
I'm new in your town
So assume what you please
But you don't know me
Say what you please
But you don't know Tina

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside

Who that mofo that came to show boat
It's 'cause he flow like no other
Styles mood his brother
And slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on track ain't a real test
The real quest, is making real tracks
With feelings people ain't feel yet
Deadly be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records
I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking
For beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line up
The bars that I could line up
Could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge
Rap is in my blood so much
My capillaries adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January
Every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times
Than my school's lunch line
So if this hit's mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty da' vocals recorded spit shine

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
[CJ Fly] And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

'Til the day I die
I'll be puffin' la
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell 'em government spies
I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move
'Cause I done move like a coward
Knowledge is power
And the flower of life is ours
Get his eyes hours
Maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind
And maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential
In our body and soul
Prolly you know
I found mines right through the pencil
Started body and flow
But fuck that
There's been a preview of primeval
Hip hop retrieval, I hold it legal
Like I'm coppers so weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top
No redo, thinking up evil but see no evil
Just because
'Cause I didn't ask to be this good
They just made me better
They told me cheese at the camps
And they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three bass, 2 Pac
But he only made one 'era
The era

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit

Homie, this shit is basic
Welcome to graduation

Everything we dreamed of

From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters saying ya changed
Now ya doing ya thing

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Good morning
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this

Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living

(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
That's that shit
So if you're gonna do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit
My dad'll say "When you see clothes close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd sent me back to school with a new wardrobe and hey!

When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'cause who the kids gonna listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the Drop Out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?

Na-na-na that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on you

I need you right now
I need you right now

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right?
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go ape shit
Especially in my pastel on my bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homie, take six, and take this, haters

I need you right now
I need you right now

Me likey

I don't know if you got a man or not,
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me

So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde-dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Ugh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

I need you right now
I need you right now

You know how long I've been on you?
Since Prince was on Appolonia
Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told you [x6]
Baby, you're making it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

I need you right now

You know how long I've been on you?
Since Prince was on Appolonia
Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told you
Never told you

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hot lines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I g-go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'm gonna get on this TV mama, I'm gonna
I'm gonna put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where niggas that sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living' spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ah
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV

The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles

The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life
Welcome to the good life

Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
(I wish a nigga would)
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Having' money's not everything, not having it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good

I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second,
Man it's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given much is tested.
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,
and what I do? Act more stupidly.
bought more jewelry, more Louis V, my momma couldn't get through to me.
The drama, people suing me,
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.
I'm just saying how I feel man,
I ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to Hill man
I guess the money should've changed him,
I guess I should've forgot where I came from.

La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors.
This is my life homey, you decide yours.
I know that Jesus died for us,
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking about back in my day
But homey this is my day.
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if magic made it.

They say I talk with so much emphasis,
Oh, they're so sensitive.
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Say something were you gone end up apologising.
Let me know if it's a problem man,
Alright man, holla then.

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,
Let that man get past.
You don't need a stop to get gas,
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of h**s?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.
Treasure. What's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.
So if the devil wear Prada,
Adam Eve wear Nada,
I'm in between, but way more fresher.
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,
That's when you die hard.
Ya homies looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my god.

Its what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it
They cant stand it, they want something new
So let's get re-acquainted
Became the hood favorite
I cant even explain it
I surprise myself too

But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career

They said he's going crazy and we seen this before
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no low-head
Cos my Dior got me more model head

You should go head
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red

Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,

Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi

Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.

OK fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidas

While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up

Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
You all brides maids catch the garter
On nights when romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van

What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammies I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little gweedo
But with my ego, I can stand there with a speedo
And still be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic
Empty bottles of no do's
Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's
The furrest man that shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that to door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinned ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what does it feel like
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone big pun big l or notorious
Fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna start killin' these niggas as soon as the chorus hit

No no I can't study war
Yeah I'm gonna start killin' these niggas soon as the chorus hit

I'm coming home again.
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again.

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said, excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me- but,
My name is Windy and, I like to blow trees and,
From that point I never blow her off,
They can come from outta town I like to show her off,
They like to act tough, she like to tow em off,
And make em straighten up their act, cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime my face lit up so astounding
And I told her in my heart is where she always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess it's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, Ye keep making that, keep making that platinum and gold for me

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Oh, now I'm coming home again

Maybe we can start again

But if you really care for her, then you would n-never hit the airport,
To follow your dream, sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking about me,
She said you left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make show beats just like you,
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what she can try to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till its gone
I guess this is why I'm here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark you lighters, wave em around,
And if you don't know by now, I'm talking about Chi Town,

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Coming home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Coming home again
Maybe we can start again

My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D My mentor
Now let the story begin

Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Coping iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out
Yell out
You know the name dude
I gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime
Let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib

Big brother was Bigs Brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out
I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that BluePrint 1
Any beats in my pocket was that Blueprint form
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by the Black album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.Bs and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
Kept little brother at bay, at a distance
Put everything I felt was more focused
Only made me more focused
Only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the todum
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrodum

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.Ds friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the presidito
Hola ovito
The game getting foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1 I'm a beat my brother
On that diamond remix I swore I spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivery, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammies I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its give and go
I guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna minggle yo.
Ya know
I told Jay I did a song with cold play
Next thing I know he got a song with coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate espanol
No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man should of told you first
But I told somebody else that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Bigs brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could smell um
A ideal in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city,Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.Ds friend
No I.D my mentor
And that's where the story ends

Don't kill this shit.....

Beef rap 
Could lead to gettin teeth capped 
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap 
I suggest ya change ya diet 
It can lead ta high blood pressure if ya fry it 
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease 
It ain't no startin back once arteries start ta squeeze 
Take the easy way out phony, until then 
They know they wouldn't be talkin that bologna in the bullpen 
So disgustin, pardon self as I discuss this 
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice 
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet 
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'a boil it 
He be better off on PC glued 
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood 
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed (food, we need food!)

He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh 
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous 
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit 
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit 
Her bra smell, his card say: aw hell 
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel' 
Keep a cooker where the jar fell 
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell 
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears 
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares 
The odd pairs swears and God fears 
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years 
I wrote this note around New Year's 
Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares? 
Enough about me, it's about the beats 
Not about the streets and who food he about ta eat 
A rhymin cannibal who's dressed to kill, it's cynical 
Whether is it animal, vegetable, or mineral 
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical 
And proceed to move the crowd like a old Negro spiritual 
For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello 
Tell 'em devil's hell no, sell y'all own Jello 
We hollow krills, she swallow pills 
He follow flea collar three dollar bills 
And squeal for halal veal, in y'all appeal 
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal 
Twirl a L after every meal (FOOD)

What up 
To all rappers shut up with ya shuttin up 
And keep your shirt on, at least a button up 
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin males? 
Outta work jerks since they shut down Chippendale's 
They chippin nails, Doom... jippin scales 
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin sales 
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin bail 
Dippin jail, whippin tail, and sippin ale 
Light the doobie til it glow like a ruby 
After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby 
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit 
Overproof drunk shit, and who'da thunk it? 
Punk try an ask why ours be better 
It could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater 
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD nude (we need food!)

KEEP YA HOES IN CHECK!(..Super!) 
I got this girl and she wants me to duke Her 
I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said "Super!"

but I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
and the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa

or beat her to a stupor, take it from the "Super!"
ya need to make her feel cuter
and lay down the G like Luther, everythin'll be "Super!"

so she look sweet when she go to meet the "Super!"
got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
put it in the air, come 'ere, kiss it

when she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
which will have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo"

make sure for extra wreck let 'em know how you feel
and while he's runnin down to all star weekend to ball
I'm comin with the U-HAUL!(Super!)
(..Super!) (...Super!)

I strive to be humble lest I stumble 
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with it's mumbo sauce 
Tyson is a Fowl holocaust
Fill and gas your whole head up with poetry I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bluh
Stand up get up
Lunge for your knife
Don't forget your potholders

What
These old things
About to throw them away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like O.J
Usually I take them off with oil of ole
MC's is crabs in a barrel pass the old bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day in it
Working on a way that we roll away tinted
Some say the price of holdin heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoe pie
[never too busy]
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
[Swear to god]
A lot of niggaz wish to die
Need to hold they horses
There's bigger fish to fry
Your on the list
If not hit the number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumbaclot
Could have had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight
Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy that night that tried to rush me
Dwight pass da dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side it wont get blistered
Got it
What happened oh it's not lit
These metal fingers be holding hot shit

When I was four I pen god was born in new york
Back in seventy seven still got nan in the crescent
The effervescent of gods presence is thick
Unlike vapor
Escarole
extra roll
Word to the baker
Peace to the hard working ginger bread makers
Looked her up and down said hmmmm too much make up
Poor music taste
Ten years from being grown up
Rappers don't blow up heads do
[awwwww shit]
My name is Dwight Spits
I'ma sonic addict
I use to think it was merely a dangling habit
Born under a bad sign
I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it in the fine wine
Barely born a virgin is what the stars said
Black not white red all over doe like elmo
Twenty eight years have passed I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore
A fact of life
A labor of love
I get mad love but I can test the labor
And it's wages
You know death
I serving life from this gift of god
Don't forget your potholders my niggaz

There is only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me
Do a number on the label
Eat up all their MC's and drink 'em under the table like
It's on me
Put it on my tab kid
However you get there
Foot it, Cab it, Iron horse it
You leaving on your face forfeit
I crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it
He told her he lost it
She told him get off it, and a bunch other more shit
Getting money
DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
It's da weed give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough
The group been soft
First hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her dareair
It read to wide load this yard bird taste like fried toad
Turned love villain
Take pride and code words
Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to dine by the pizza guy
No he's not to fly to skeet in a skezzers eye
And squeeze her thigh
Maybe giver her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call him super when they need their back or plumbing fixed
Powers only one left the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three
A hood tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like what you doing G
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me
Looser than a pair of adidas
I hope you bought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
Dude can't do his thing again no matter how be blinging
You do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for tellie tubbies
Few can do it even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask like a tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out
One, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shootie nobody move nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy I'm going to war
Came in the door, and everybody on the floor
A whole string of jobs like we are on tour
Everynight on the score coming to your corner store

As you call em, they call you when they need somethin 
Trees for the blunt 'n, to g's for the frontin
I found a way to get piece of mind for years
And left the hell alone, turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter, or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright wit surprise, once they finish spittin lies
Asssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggaz, homies?
close, but really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn't even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: no feeding the baboon
Seein as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Ya'll know the dance, they smile in ya face, ya'll know the glance
Try ta put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know ya plans
Is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see
You telling me, I try ta act broke
Jealousy, the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type a spell, like crack smoke
Ghetto cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I check the dictionary for the meanin of Friends
It said: Person, one who likes to socialize with
Sympathise and help her, and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, goin wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggaz off like a light switch
(Click!) an when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night (Bow!) what a riot
I first met Mister Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how yer moms'll feel
When it get for real, the steel get to sparkin
Everything darken, and ain't no talkin
For somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin ta plot the bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is...
Some come in the form of co-dependence
Alotta times only end up bein co-defendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, beggin for a penance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory
Before lovers we used to have some type of overstanding
Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know its no strings
We could do the damn thing, but hoe its no rings
Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?
That depends on how good was the skins
And could she memorize the lessons, it ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just... (friends)
FRIENDS! How many of us have them?
FRIENDS! Ones we can depend on?
FRIENDS! How many of us have them?
FRIENDS! Before we go any furthur....

I tripped a lot out here in the woods lately

This is a platter of, this makes an, an exceptionally good late night's snack and also a dandy fly swatter
Ah, my eyes are going, I can't hit it

Nothing comes between me and my masters

(What is it father?)
These footprints were by, by the flying monkey men
(But they've been restrained in the Valley since we made the pig feet)
Yes, that is what disturbs me

He'd probably get indigestion
You will go
(I don't think so
Take them)

This jungle is dangerous Trapper
You will need assistance
(I know what I'm doing)

You risked your life for us, thanks

I lost an arm
(Good)
Stop it father
(Stand back
Return to the house)
No

What the?
Now Trapper, perhaps you will listen

You gotta watch your gums on this
But it's, it's very good, it's very healthy

(Not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal)
You would only want to use the wraps when there's no food associated with the use of the wraps
So, uh, some potential uses include, um, wrapping bolt packed in a larger package
And in that case, the, the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked, cooked your meats
Um, there's also been interest in, um, development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day
(It's hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things
Create a new demand for produce
Stop throwing out as much garbage as they do
And eat more chitlins)

Darker than the East river, larger than the Empire State
Where the beasts to guard the barbed wire gate is on the job not my fate
Tired of the wait till the villain bring deliverance from the dire straits, fire at a higher rate
Why'd they make the liars, fliers scatter, buy a plate, isolate the wires
Try the straight pliers if not the vice grips
A real price saver way to acquire nice whips
What a steal for real on wheels of steel
Stunner a funner summer number one meal deal bummer
A bizarre phenomenon is your armor on
Take your cash, Karma, or break your fast, Ramadan
Transaction drama, aww come on Barney
Clack clack, pardon me, whack rap con carne
He came to feed the childrens like Sally Struthers
After that he's going back to Cali where's the (Love is)

Wilder than the Nile, hold power like the great pyramids of Giza
And stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza
Raw with the pen and on the mic off the hezza
Get shot off that wide eyed talk
If he had a pot he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street person
Lookin' for the perfect beat coercion into heat burstin'
They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that comes with a free hot plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3D ring sittin' stationary like B.B. King
Can see how it really sting, it ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motocross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus
Me and Sub is like the brown Smothers Brothers (Love is)

Vaster than the seven seas, bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro
If they don't know, fill them in tomorrow on the horror show
A mental note, return Bob's record
Swear to god before he gets a job, he robs Eckerd
Blessed with a hot flow, tested, it got dough
Invested in stress the best to finesse an opto
As I reminisce never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the Henny straight couldn't afford to cop the cherry coke
Or should I say broke with wealth?
To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke theyself
Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it
Dog gone it, do the statistics
How he bust lyrics was too futuristic for ballistics
And far too eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc the Hip Hop Hendrix

In my pocket, a note
(It's from my father
From the guard's whip, is this a trick?)
Why would I resort to trickery?
You're already a prisoner
What do I gain by deceiving you?
(You can't blame me for being suspicious)
No (Love is)

Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the drill that gave my spine chills
All thirty-three nerves controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like sent from above
You not a soul-mate, more ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions outta here. sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me
I couldn't see, holdin' onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

I shoulda deaded it from genesis 'stead of hittin' the Guinnesses
Now I'm free falling, cursing at the street, bawling
He ceased calling, no appetite for feast darling
So deep, all in, I bet he never stop balling women
Forsake God for the scent of a man
Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?
Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment
Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it
Damn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke
Steady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats
Sniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope?
Propose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

Constant frustration, stemming from a no win situation
Rushing lust and fornication, adding to the complication
Patience is a virtue, pain run deep when love desert you
Listenin' to whisperin', choosing chaos over discipline
Simpleton, life should really be a piece of intimance
Relationships strengthening, flower essence penstemon
Gentlemen my favorite shit so I've never forsaken it
I persevere, make it fit, sculpting and reshaping it
Taking sips off a fifth of it, passionate, intense
Incense candles lit, scandalous
Emotional bandages, why would he abandon this?
Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming, take cover, hit the dirt

On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

Look
(Oh boy, here we go)

Come on you college boys wearing them faggotty-looking white shoes

Ya didn't wash your neck
(Take a look at my neck)

Hold it right there you
Where you're going, there are no jokes

I'm beginning to think that armor-plated gargoyle doesn't like me

...Give it a sec for the pain to start
This wreck right here it ain't for the faint of heart
They thought they saw the worst verse
From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first
Once they get to know us people dig us
Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggaz
Inventor of the more demented flow nobody doubt it
This go for if ya bout it bout it or rowdy rowdy
Whatever's clever the master fold
Who every hooka heard a but now HO NO
If we see tomorrow the next day classes
The villain in the back with the x-ray glasses
Have no fear the ninja here
Feel em like the tinge in ya ear from drinkin ginger beer
When it's on loco head gon' lay low
And heat it like beef patty coco bread con queso
If you say so lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halo's
Say OH if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash then a stash in a peso
Okay yo ya'll know who to follow
Tie em up in the crib and leave the place hollow
..Oh shoot the goose shes loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste cous cous
Stash the deuce deuce
Troops askin truce truce
Today on intense wreck week
We have the super villain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks
Train the same brain to a insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain ya support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make ya daughta laugh
Then slaughta the ass
Seem em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do something and never be back once he leave the scene
Keep more medicated pads then Stridex
For his own sidewrecks with no known side effects
Before you press charges use ya noodle
So what when he grab the mic he scratch ya cute cuticles
Keep ya mouth shut everything'll be beautiful
It would be often rude to you now get back to ya hooty hoo
Damnit it ain't worth the drama can it
From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in he lit the room
Boom reschedule my noon with Britt Hume (Doom!)
In love with Mary Jane she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that webhead what a lame brain
Maintain say it don't spray it
Wanna see ya girl again ya might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer who bust guns
I'll have a cool mill for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One two microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home-Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage its like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
Jump off the stage like "Yee haw!"

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

Type profile low, like A in Paid in Full
Attract heavy cash 'cause the game's centripetal
Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic
Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown nosing nigga, fake-ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas, come get me 'cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangster like a old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah yeah, tell 'em "Tell it on the mountain hill"
Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through the bubble vest or double-breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap
Son shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rap snitch knishes

It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs was touchin' never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell yous
Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, "Daddy funk me"
I'm like anywho's
Seeds walkin' all out in street with out any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox
Instead she wanna hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory glory, it's like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low
Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo
Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier
Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated in deep theta
Let her hate the creep later
Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
Say he stay self medicated to sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ewww
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit (DOOM)

One little evening alone home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking e-mails
All I got is messages from ass-naked females (Cookies)
I don't know a Jenny
She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
(Night, night) Okay honey, sweet dreams
Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal hand full, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I right there with ya
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you could do the same till he get home
Fat chance, at least he get snacks
That will have to do till a brother get back
Until then, smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers
Acting all hard, bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is, "Thirteenth cell, put the sheet down"
Damn CO, what the hell do she know
Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The whiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, it's hard to drink without it
And could use some cookies but trying not to think about it
Watching BET on jazz for knowledge on file
Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch, like we got for lunch
Chocolate fudge butter crunch

Don't mess with the Ritz Bits
Wheat Thins, Saltines, or Triscuits (No)
Matzos or Cheez-Its
Catch sugar fits every time that he sees a nice pair of
Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
Even the Oreos, no matter what weather
Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
In the game he's shameless
Even uses a codename Famous Amos
It's cheaper than a short stay at the day's inn
And good like twenty-five cent oatmeal raisin
Give a hand to who invented the camera
Never mind the gingerbread man or the grandmas
Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
Or get caught with a handful of cream fill
(Cookies) It might seem ill

(Go wash your hands)
Cookies
(Oh, cookies)

We shall now vote for a new world leader
I nominate DOOM
All in favor say, "Aye"
(Aye) Oh no
(Point blank)

DOOM is master of the world
(I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book)
You've disturbed me for the last time

Hey you know something gang?
That DOOM ain't really all bad
(What do you mean Ben?)
Well on account of him, I'm having real good time I mean
Between you and me, I kinda like being black
(Well maybe if we're lucky, he'll attack us once more and send you back Benjamin)
Haha very funny, very very funny

(He must be mad)
No, if anyone can do it
Nevertheless let's get out of here while we can
(Food, we need food)
